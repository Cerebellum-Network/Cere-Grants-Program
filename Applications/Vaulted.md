### Overview  
- Project Name: Vaulted - Decentralized Storage Platform  
- Brief Description:  
  Vaulted is a user-friendly decentralized storage solution built on Cere Network’s DDC, offering secure file management with Web2-to-Web3 onboarding. The platform simplifies sharing for both registered and unregistered users while integrating referral incentives to drive adoption. This project expands on our hackathon-winning prototype ([PolkadotHH](https://github.com/elbarroca/PolkadotHH)), which demonstrated core DDC capabilities. Our team is uniquely positioned to deliver this due to prior experience with Cere’s ecosystem and technical mentorship from Dengun Incubator.
