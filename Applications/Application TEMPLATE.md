## Development Roadmap

> This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. 
> Describe *the functionality expected in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. 
> Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

> For each milestone,
> - make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
> - include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
> - include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
> - provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
> - commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
> - indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
> - *Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory* and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> We *suggest* scoping the project to fit in a three-month period, and to structure the roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.
